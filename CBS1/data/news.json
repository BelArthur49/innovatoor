Marie Alice Kayumba Uwera, Executive Director in Charge of National Unity and Community Resilience at the Ministry of National Unity and Civic Engagement (MINUBUMWE); Mr. Patrick Ufashingabo, Advisor to the Minister at the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF); Priest Rutayisire from Butare Diocese; Senior Superintendent Olive Mukantabana representing Rwanda Correctional Service (RCS); and Beatrice, Director of Nyamagabe Correctional Facility.</p><p>Two main conversations marked the day. The first, led by MIGEPROF, focused on gender equality and equity. Participants engaged actively, asking questions that reflected their long absence from society and their desire to understand current legal and social frameworks.</p><p>The second conversation was delivered by Priest Rutayisire, who spoke on sin, redemption, and how to live peacefully with others. Quoting Scripture, he reminded them that the greatest commandment is love—for God, for others, and for oneself.</p><p>In her speech, Hon. Marie Alice Kayumba reflected on the purpose of the training. She emphasized the importance of understanding the impact of the Genocide against the Tutsi not only on the participants themselves, but also on their families, survivors, and the country.</p><p>She urged them to take active steps toward rebuilding social harmony by telling their families the truth about the crimes they committed, seeking forgiveness from those they harmed, and engaging in national development through community-based programs such as Umuganda, community assemblies, and social activities.</p><p>Some of the inmates were released on the same day. Their families were invited to attend the event to help them better understand their role in welcoming their relatives back and supporting them in rebuilding their lives.</p><p>At CBS, we remain committed to supporting the psychosocial wellbeing of individuals affected by a painful past and helping communities rebuild trust and resilience.</p>",

        "content": "<p>At its core, <strong>conviviality</strong> represents warmth, joy, and shared moments of connection. It is about coming together in an atmosphere of friendliness and celebration. At CBS, Conviviality embodies this spirit in a profound way—it is a special event that marks the completion of the 15-week <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> sociotherapy process, where participants celebrate their journey of healing and transformation.</p><p><strong>What is Conviviality in CBS?</strong><br>In CBS, Conviviality is more than just an event; it is the culmination of shared experiences, personal growth, and strengthened bonds. It offers participants an opportunity to reflect on their healing journey, reconnect with their group, and embrace the transformation they have undergone. After 15 weeks of deep discussions, emotional breakthroughs, and mutual support, participants gather to honor their progress in a meaningful and joyful way.</p><p>Before reaching this celebration, participants go through an intentional healing process. CBS sociotherapists, working in pairs, engage communities to form groups of 15 individuals. These groups then embark on the <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> experience—a name chosen by the community itself after witnessing the powerful impact of sociotherapy. Over the course of 15 weeks, participants share lived experiences, rebuild trust, and strengthen resilience, supported consistently by CBS staff and sociotherapists.</p><p>On Conviviality Day, participants embrace the moment with excitement and pride. Dressed in their best outfits, they create an atmosphere filled with warmth and joy. Each group chooses how to celebrate—some present sketches and poems, while others sing or dance. However, the highlight of the day remains the testimonies. These powerful stories of personal transformation leave a lasting impression on participants and invited guests alike, including CBS staff, community members, and local leaders.</p><p>The presence of local leaders is particularly meaningful, as it allows them to witness firsthand the impact of sociotherapy within their communities. Observing the transformation of participants reinforces the importance of such programs and encourages continued support for healing and reconciliation initiatives. These testimonies often shift perspectives and spread messages of hope and restoration.</p><p>True to the essence of conviviality, the celebration is marked by togetherness and sharing. Participants bring and share food and drinks, reinforcing values of unity and generosity. More than a simple gathering, this shared moment symbolizes their collective journey—one filled with struggles, breakthroughs, and ultimately, healing.</p><p>Beyond the celebration, Conviviality stands as a testament to the power of human connection. It demonstrates that when people come together in an atmosphere of trust and openness, healing becomes possible. Those who witness it often leave inspired, carrying renewed hope shaped by the resilience and courage of the participants.</p><p>At CBS, Conviviality is the embodiment of healing, joy, and the strength of community—a reminder that transformation is most powerful when it is shared.</p>",

The visit focused on food security, civil society, and the legacies of the 1994 genocide in the context of the transition from aid to trade.</p><p>Accompanied by His Excellency Matthijs Wolters, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Rwanda, the delegation visited Rubavu District to see the work of Community Based Sociotherapy (<em>Mvura Nkuvure</em>). They met sociotherapy groups of youth, genocide survivors, and former perpetrators, conducted a focus group with sociotherapists, and observed how graduates started their own socio-economic initiatives.</p><figure><img src='img/news/Dutch-Visit-to-Mvura-Nkuvure-in-Rubavu-2.jpg' alt='Mvura Nkuvure graduates producing handicrafts'><figcaption>Mvura Nkuvure graduates continue to meet and produce handicraft products to generate income.</figcaption></figure><p>Jean Pierre Naramabuye, a member of one of the visited groups, shared how <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> transformed his life. During the 1994 genocide, he had wrongly accused someone of looting his property, which led the accused person to give up land and fall into poverty. After attending sociotherapy sessions, Naramabuye recognized the harm caused and returned the land. He told the delegation that their visit made participants feel supported and remembered, adding that although many lost family members, such visits show that they still have people who care and listen to their stories.</p><p>Eva Meijers, clerk of the delegation, said she was deeply moved by what she witnessed. She praised the steps taken toward reconciliation after a traumatic past and expressed admiration for the strength and resilience of the participants. She encouraged them to maintain their achievements and continue striving for the development of their families.</p><p>Meijers also visited a group of sociotherapy graduates who started socio-economic activities after completing <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em>. The group, composed of former prisoners and genocide survivors, produces and sells traditional handicrafts.</p><p>Lucie Nzaramba, Executive Director of Community Based Sociotherapy, said the visit was a symbolic milestone for the program. She noted that while reports communicate progress, field visits allow stakeholders to directly interact with those whose lives have been transformed. She thanked the Embassy for initiating the visit and expressed appreciation for the delegation’s time and engagement with participants.</p><p>On the final day of the visit, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Kigali expressed gratitude for the warm welcome and stated that the visit was an important opportunity to further strengthen relations between Rwanda and the Netherlands.</p>",

The Open Day provided an opportunity for CBS Rwanda to meet and interact with various stakeholders.

        "excerpt": "The first People’s Parliament.",
        "content": "<p>The main actors that can make peace long-lasting are community members who have been directly or indirectly affected by past conflicts. It is therefore important that communities have platforms where they can share ideas on how peace can be strengthened. Grassroots advocacy—organizing, mobilizing, and engaging the public to advocate for themselves—is a suitable approach. This is what the People’s Parliaments for Peace (PP4P), part of the <em>Tujyane</em> project (Let’s Go Together), aims to achieve. The first two PP4P sessions took place in Nyamasheke and Rusizi districts and were appreciated by district authorities.</p><p>PP4P are platforms created by community members to share obstacles that hamper peacebuilding and to present recommendations to local authorities and community leaders. PP4P were initiated by Community Based Sociotherapy (CBS Rwanda) in 2018 and are currently part of the <em>Tujyane</em> project, implemented in partnership with Radio La Benevolencija (RLB) and funded by the European Union.</p><p>The district-level PP4P sessions were organized by Musekeweya Listening Club members from each district. These clubs, established in 2017, meet weekly to listen to the radio drama <em>Musekeweya</em> (A New Dawn). They promote peace by countering genocide ideology and mediating family conflicts, positioning themselves as active bystanders in the road to sustainable peace. According to Nicolas Habarugira, CBS Coordinator of the Tujyane Project, these clubs serve as effective community channels for advocacy. Participants represented sectors in Nyamasheke (Macuba, Mahembe, Kagano, Nyabitekeri, Gihombo) and Rusizi (Kampembe, Rugarama, Nkungu, Nkaka, Nkombo).</p><figure><img src='img/news/Mvura-Nkuvure-in-Rusizi_PP4P_Rusizi_2022.jpg' alt='Rusizi district local leaders and PP4P representatives'><figcaption>Rusizi district local leaders, CBS Rwanda, and PP4P representatives from Rusizi District.</figcaption></figure><p>Before the PP4P sessions, CBS Rwanda and RLB delivered a five-day training on Grassroots Advocacy, Active Bystandership, and the Continuum of Violence. Habarugira explained that this equipped listening club facilitators with skills to guide PP4P and identify and analyze community problems that obstruct socio-economic development and peacebuilding.</p><p>Together with community members, facilitators designed ‘problem trees’ that mapped community problems (trunk), root causes (roots), and consequences (branches). They then created ‘solution trees’ outlining actions (roots), the shared vision (trunk), and expected results (branches). Representatives—three per club per district—presented these outcomes to district authorities, focusing on genocide ideology, family conflicts, domestic violence, school dropouts, and consequences of trauma.</p><figure><img src='img/news/Mvura-Nkuvure-in-Rusizi_PP4P_Problem-Tree.jpg' alt='Problem tree presentation in Rusizi'><figcaption>Problem tree presentation by a PP4P representative in Rusizi.</figcaption></figure><p>Mr. Jean Claude Uwineza, Nyamasheke Council Advisor, praised community members for contributing to sustainable peace and proposed organizing similar PP4P sessions across all 18 sectors of Nyamasheke to address barriers to socio-economic development, reconciliation, and peacebuilding.</p><p>The <em>Tujyane</em> project, launched in 2020, aims to support national efforts toward sustainable peace through democratization and prisoner reintegration. PP4P are expected to play a key role. In total, five clubs per district participated in the training, totaling about 200 participants from 10 sectors.</p>",

The certificates recognized their efforts during the 30-month implementation of the Community Based Sociotherapy Adapted for Refugees (COSTAR) project and their continuous commitment to successfully close the project.</p><p>The COSTAR project was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and, in Uganda, jointly implemented by the University of Liverpool, Makerere University, Humanitarian Initiative Just Relief Aid (HIJRA), and Community Based Sociotherapy (CBS Rwanda).</p><p>The project aimed to culturally and linguistically adapt the CBS approach for Congolese refugees and to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-efficiency in addressing elevated levels of mental health difficulties among populations affected by conflict and displacement.</p><p>According to the project coordinator, Emmanuel Sarabwe, COSTAR was implemented to assess how Community-Based Sociotherapy could contribute to reducing symptoms of depression among refugees. During the certificate-awarding ceremony, Sarabwe highlighted the dedication of the sociotherapists in learning and applying the approach. He explained that many of them grew stronger over time and were able to facilitate group sessions smoothly while also supporting their own healing and that of participants.</p><p>Sarabwe noted that the main challenges during implementation included the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as situations where some participants expected material support to attend sessions. He also mentioned that the demands of rigorous scientific research sometimes conflicted with the flexible nature of the CBS approach, which needs to adapt to local realities.</p><p>Despite these challenges, there is strong hope that the achievements of the CBS participants will continue to influence their lives positively. Participants who attended the 15 weekly sociotherapy sessions reported improved social relations across differences in tribe, gender, religion, and education level. Many described their groups as becoming like a family.</p><p>Some participants shared that, before joining the groups, they experienced serious emotional distress, but through the sociotherapy process they felt more connected and hopeful. Others resolved marital and family conflicts, with some couples reuniting after long separations. Neighbors who had been in conflict also reconciled and began supporting one another. Overall, participants indicated that being part of the sociotherapy groups helped them reconnect with others and contributed to their mental well-being.</p><figure><img src='img/news/Mvura-Nkuvure-in-Kyangwali_COSTAR1.jpg' alt='Kyangwali sociotherapists ceremony'><figcaption>The Kyangwali sociotherapists during the certificate-awarding ceremony.</figcaption></figure>",

        "content": "<p>Mvura Nkuvure groups that initiated socio-economic activities after completing 15 weekly sociotherapy sessions are receiving coaching sessions to enhance their skills and sustain their initiatives. The groups were carefully selected based on their time of existence, their achievements so far, and their action plans outlining their future ambitions.</p><p>Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda (CBS Rwanda) and its partner organizations—Eglise Anglicane au Rwanda (EAR)-Byumba and Prison Fellowship Rwanda (PFR)—introduced a coaching program to empower Mvura Nkuvure graduates who started socio-economic activities after completing 15 sociotherapy sessions. According to Diogene Karangwa, Mvura Nkuvure Project Coordinator, more than 60% of the groups decided to stay together to generate income and facilitate inclusive socio-economic development while maintaining their social cohesion.</p><p>Jacqueline Mukamana, a sociotherapist from Burera District, explained that continued group meetings after Mvura Nkuvure show that participants trust one another. She noted that sustaining this recovered trust requires continued collaboration through socio-economic initiatives. Karangwa added that the purpose is not only social connection but also collective socio-economic development. Phoibe Nyirakamonyo, a participant from Nyamagabe District, reaffirmed that social relations at community level have improved through Mvura Nkuvure and enabled groups to pursue shared economic goals.</p><p>To ensure the effectiveness of the coaching component, CBS Rwanda and its partners recruited nine professional business coaches to accompany selected groups. The coaching is conducted nationwide across all Mvura Nkuvure intervention areas. In the first phase, 135 groups were targeted for coaching and capacity building. These groups are located in nine districts: Gasabo, Nyamagabe, Muhanga, Nyanza, Gicumbi, Rulindo, Burera, Rubavu, and Karongi. Selection was based on achievements and future-oriented action plans.</p><p>The coaching initiative arose from field observations. Karangwa noted that while many groups achieved a lot, gaps were observed in the management of their cooperatives or associations. The recruited coaches were trained in the Community-Based GROW Coaching Model to build the capacity of Mvura Nkuvure groups in visioning, planning, execution, and sustaining their socio-economic initiatives.</p><p>The GROW (Goal, Reality, Options, Way forward) Coaching Model can be compared to planning a journey: first setting the goal, then assessing the current reality, exploring options, and finally committing to the way forward while anticipating obstacles.</p><p>As Karangwa explained, the model assumes that the coach is not an expert in the group’s situation, but a facilitator who helps members select the best options without giving direct advice or instructions.</p><p>Clementine Mukamana, a Mvura Nkuvure coach from Gasabo District, expressed confidence in the coaching approach. She said she intends to work closely with group members, building on what they have already achieved through regular visits to proactively overcome challenges.</p><p>After the coaching phase, the selected groups are expected to receive seed capital to help them launch profitable community-level initiatives. It is hoped that these activities will not only foster socio-economic growth but also strengthen the social fabric of communities. The groups consist largely of Mvura Nkuvure graduates, as well as community members who joined later.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of so many people all over the world, including Rwanda. The sociotherapy group sessions in Gasabo district have also stopped temporarily due to the recent lockdown in Kigali city. However, it does not mean the sociotherapists in Gasabo district have stopped their support completely. Instead they are using their <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> knowledge and skills to support families mentally and physically during these hard times.</p><p>Gasabo district currently counts for 29 sociotherapists who are facilitating in total 15 <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> groups that come together on a weekly basis. The time they stopped the <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> sessions due to the lockdown, they were on their second and third week of the cycle of 15 weekly group sessions.</p><p>Though according to COVID-19 prevention measures, <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> participants are not allowed to meet, sociotherapists regularly check on the participants through phone calls to mentally support them and listen to them, to see whether they may have problems which need to be communicated to competent institutions for support. These issues include COVID-19 testing, medical support, and food distribution.</p><p>Beyond these regular tasks and roles, as sociotherapists, they have now also taken upon other responsibilities to help other community members during these hard times of lockdown. Jean Damascene Barahira is from Bumbogo sector. He was selected at sector level to facilitate the process of food distribution to poor households. He feels proud and confident to support others during these challenging times, because it is like the extension of his role as a sociotherapist. According to Damascene, sociotherapy trainings have equipped him with practical knowledge and skills to know how to manage personal hard situations and providing care to others.</p><p>His counterpart, a sociotherapist from Rusororo sector, Françoise Furere, is a community health worker. Caring for others, listening and analyzing are the skills she referred to when talking about what she gained from attending sociotherapy trainings. She shares that they help her a lot when visiting and counselling community members who are tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>Reverend Pastor Jean Damascene Nteziyaremye is also a sociotherapist from Rutunga sector. As a church leader, he conducts public mobilization in Gaseke, a trading center (Mutete sector / Gicumbi district) neighboring Rutunga sector. He uses the Ishingiro radio channel to combine the teachings in relation to his religion with what he has learned from the <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> approach to mentally support the audience. He is devoted to continue providing this support throughout these difficult times.  </p><figure><img src='img/news/Sociotherapist-Nteziyaremye-in-pubic-mobilisation_covid19.jpeg' alt='Reverend Pastor Jean Damascene in Gaseke'><figcaption>Reverend Pastor Jean Damascene in public mobilization in Gaseke trading center.</figcaption></figure><p>Reverend Damascene has currently a number of families that he is closely monitoring, but despite other duties, he is not tired because of the principles of <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em>: they are supporting him, he said.</p><figure><img src='img/news/Gasabo-Sociotherapist-Nteziyaremye.jpeg' alt='Nteziyaremye at Ishingiro Radio'><figcaption>Nteziyaremye at Ishingiro Radio.</figcaption></figure><p>“I go like a professional, because I have learnt from <em>Mvura Nkuvure</em> how to listen, care for others, counsel and analyze a problem and most importantly to help others to have hope,” said Angelique Umurerwa.</p><figure><img src='img/news/Angelique-Umurerwa-Nduba-Sociotherapists.jpeg' alt='Angelique Umurerwa'><figcaption>Angelique Umurerwa, in red-yellow kitenge, handing food supplies to a family member she is monitoring in Nduba sector during lockdown.</figcaption></figure><p>Angelique Umurerwa is a sociotherapist from Nduba sector. She has currently more than 34 COVID-19 patients she is monitoring. As she confirmed, it is not an easy task to visit COVID-19 patients. There is a time you get in a family and you find three family members are in great need of moral support. It is not easy to mentally support them, but as we have learnt how to listen and care for others, I do it as my profession and consistently. I feel happy when I see them after some time they are regaining hope, Umurerwa said.</p>",
