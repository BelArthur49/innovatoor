                                Community-based sociotherapy is an approach used to support people in constructively dealing with the psychosocial consequences of war, genocide, violence and other forms of human suffering.<br> The approach uses the group
                                as a therapeutic medium to create trust, an open environment for discussion and the formation of peer-support structures. <br>The uniqueness of sociotherapy is that it is done at community level with people from the same
                                neighbourhood usually representing different socio-historical backgrounds (e.g. genocide survivors or genocide perpetrators), linking the process of psychosocial recovery to the process of grassroots peacebuilding:

                                        <p class="mb-0">Reconciliation can be distinguished in ‘thin’ and ‘thick’ reconciliation, respectively kubana and ubwiyunge in Kinyarwanda. The first stands for living together as a matter of necessity, while the latter is a matter
                                            of the heart and a state of feeling in social relations. Ubwiyunge involves speaking truthfully and honestly between conflicting parties about what happened in the past that has divided them and starting new
                                            relationships based on trust and respect. Both aspects of reconciliation can be perceived as integral parts of peacebuilding. Peacebuilding is concerned with short-term responses to complex and violent conflicts
                                            and long-term responses to build the capacity of societies in the aftermath of violent conflict, preventing them from drifting back into violence. It is an integral part of helping societies to economically,
                                            politically, socially and culturally. It does all this by addressing the intangible and tangible psychological, relational and structural elements of complex issues in an integrated way. It is the interlinked
                                            psychological and relational elements of peacebuilding that ubwiyunge represents. Community-based sociotherapy proves to be able to facilitate its participants in achieving ubwiyunge and thus contribute to peacebuilding.
                                            It is in this sense that the sociotherapy approach can be defined as a psychosocial peacebuilding approach.

                                            The composite term of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) refers to any type of support that aims to protect or promote psychosocial wellbeing or prevent or treat mental disorders. Conflict and violence generate psychosocial impacts on the
                                            communities that experienced it, and these impact transcends the individual, household and community level. In the context of Rwanda, the society as a whole was affected by the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.
                                            A collective traumatic experience that not only asks for an individual journey of trauma recovery, but moreover a trauma that needs to be resolved within the interpersonal space and social environment. Especially
                                            in the context of Rwanda, whereby the level of violence happened at an intimate level, the psychosocial healing process should also take place in an environment characterized by intimacy. Community-based sociotherapy
                                            is in its very nature a community-based psychosocial approach. In the recent years, there have been more attention for integrating MHPSS programs in peacebuilding efforts. CBS is actually looking at peacebuilding
                                            through a psychosocial lens, arguing that MHPSS services are not merely about treating individuals and groups to recover from and/or prevent consequences from traumatic experiences, but that psychosocial wellbeing
                                            is actually a prerequisite for peace, social change and economic prosperity. A lot of our research also taps into this interlinkage.

                                            Over the years, team members overseeing the implementation of the sociotherapy approach, observed that disturbed family dynamics are a prominent issue in Rwanda. Exploration of this issue led to a few studies that gave evidence that genocide legacies
                                            affecting parents may have a negative impact on their offspring, which in turn may affect the so-called second generation (those who were too young during the genocide to consciously experience it and those
                                            born after the genocide) and impact on their attitudes and behaviour regarding reconciliation. Sociotherapy was one of the first entities to draw attention to the need of policy makers and practitioners to constructively
                                            address these intergenerational legacies of genocide. While over the years knowledge about these legacies – specifically regarding the intergenerational transmission of trauma and violence – has been gained
                                            regarding the Holocaust, the post-genocide situation in Rwanda is quite unique because of the nature of the genocide against the Tutsi and the transitional justice mechanisms implemented by the Rwandan government
                                            in its aftermath. A variety of approaches to public memorialisation and the community justice system Gacaca stand out in this respect. However, we found that what applies to descendants of Holocaust perpetrators
                                            and victims also applies to descendants of victims and perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda. McGlothin (2006: 14), for instance, argues with reference to the Holocaust that while the legacy transmitted to
                                            the second generation is quite different for the two groups, the general position of the children to their parents’ pasts is quite similar: “Both groups feel marked by the Holocaust, an event that is ever present
                                            in their lives but not personally experienced, and both struggle to understand their own place in the world in light of their link to the traumatic past”. Studies conducted in Rwanda in the context of sociotherapy
                                            indicated that intergenerational legacies of genocide are a risk factor of the internalization of sentiments of divisionism or even genocide ideology among the second generation. These studies as well as the
                                            many testimonies collected in sociotherapy booklets, however, also gave evidence that as a result of participation by parents and by youth in sociotherapy groups, social relations between previous adversaries
                                            in the genocide conflict and between the descendants of both improve. One factor that significantly contributes to this is the revitalization of sociotherapy graduates resulting in an improvement of their economic
                                            situation. We consider the negative effects of the intergenerational transmission of genocide legacies as one the core challenges in making the fragile and complex processes of reconciliation and peacebuilding
                                            sustainable. Not recognizing the consequences of these legacies and not timely intervening may keep cycles of trauma and violence alive, as can be observed in the history of violent conflict in the Great Lakes
                                            Region (including pre-genocide Rwanda), South Africa, the Middle East, Myanmar, the Balkans and many other parts of the world

                                        <p class="mb-0">It is recommendable for the achievement of effective and rapid reintegration that reconciliation between genocide perpetrators and their families and communities already starts in prison. Usually prisoners have
                                            limited opportunity to interact with the people they offended. In so far as this interaction is possible, psychological distress resulting from the crimes committed and the life in prison constrain prisoners
                                            from engaging themselves in reconciliation processes. Feelings of worthlessness and guilt, suicide attempts, insomnia, depression, a distorted self-image and trauma are severely affecting their lives. As a result,
                                            they are mostly focused on their own suffering and tend to overlook that of others. If left unaddressed, this impoverished psychosocial well-being is likely to hamper processes of social reintegration and reconciliation
                                            upon their release. In time this might fuel future conflicts and violence at family and community level. Therefore, the reintegration process that former prisoners go through in their family and community is
                                            on of the key themes that CBS Rwanda focuses on.

                                            and family issues, identify and analyze the community issues that influence the daily lives of people and form a risk factor for sustainable peace and development of their communities. Through the “People’s

                                            The increased level of psychosocial well-being among graduates of sociotherapy, interpersonal reconciliation and social cohesion are the factors that also facilitate engagement in economic development. As groups that have done a healing journey together
                                            for about 15 weeks, sociotherapy graduates decide to remain and work together for them to sustain new life orientation they benefit from the healing journey. The groups are characterized by trust, togetherness
                                            and most of the time are people with different historical background who have decide to change mindset from the history of conflict and violence to a united association and community. Main activities performed
                                            by sociotherapy graduates are agriculture, saving and loans among members, breeding, etc. This is the foundation of sustainability of sociotherapy where hundreds of sociotherapy graduates have initiated income
                                            generating activities, different socioeconomic development projects Improved psychosocial lives also empowers sociotherapy graduates to think of economic growth and poverty alleviation from individual, family

                                            <br><br> Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda (CBS) and its project partners Anglican Church of Rwanda, Byumba Diocese and Prison fellowship Rwanda (PFR) have joined their efforts to specifically work on 1) facilitating
                                            the psychosocial reintegration of (ex-)prisoners, 2) addressing intergenerational legacies of the genocide that can be perceived as risk factors hampering reconciliation in the long term, and 3) the reinforcement
                                            of ownership among (local) leaders, teachers, other professionals who can be expected to make a difference in society. The three years project (2018-2021 works with people with different socio-historical backgrounds
                                            in local communities and schools in 9 districts (Muhanga, Nyamagabe, Nyanza, Rubavu, Gasabo, Karongi, Gicumbi, Burera and Rulindo) and in prisons (Muhanga, Huye, Nyarugenge, Rubavu and Gicumbi prison). Through
                                            the 250 well trained sociotherapists in both local communities and prisons, it is expected that the project will have more than 12,000 participants.

                                                <h3>Participatory Action Research (PAR) Approach</h3>

                                                <p>CBS research uses a <strong>Participatory Action Research (PAR)</strong> approach. This method has as its two main goals the achievement of both <strong>action</strong> and <strong>research</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>PAR is a very effective method as it constantly monitors the intervention. Simultaneously, the researcher has an active advisory role in the implementation and can suggest alternative strategies based on
                                                    research observations while taking the specific context in which the intervention is applied into account.</p>

                                                <h3 class="mt-4">Key Characteristics of PAR</h3>

                                                <p>Participatory Action Research has a number of defining characteristics:</p>

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><strong>Participative:</strong> All stakeholders are involved in the research, from the advisory committee to the sociotherapists at the grass roots level.</li>

                                                    <li><strong>Mixed Methods Research:</strong> The main focus lies on descriptions and on understanding social complexities via qualitative methods, while a general picture of the results will be generated
                                                        through quantitative research. This combination of methods strengthens the qualitative data and provides a deeper understanding of the quantitative data.</li>

                                                    <li><strong>Reflective:</strong> Critical reflection on the intervention process and its outcomes are important features.</li>

                                                    <li><strong>Responsive:</strong> The researcher is able to respond to emerging difficulties during the implementation and immediately take action.</li>

                                                    <li><strong>Emergent and Cyclical:</strong> The process takes places gradually over a number of cycles so that interpretations of data can be tested, challenged, and refined.</li>

                                        <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                                        <p>26 years after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda ended, the impact of unaddressed trauma continues to influence the daily lives of many Rwandans. As the genocide took place at the community – and often
                                            very intimate – level, the social fabric within communities and families has been severely damaged. The trauma experienced continues to shape attitudes to reconciliation in the population. The reintegration
                                            and rehabilitation of the (soon to be) released prisoners into their families and communities threatens now to aggravate this intergenerational trauma and within the country’s reconciliation process.</p>

                                        <p>To continue its efforts of contributing to psychosocial recovery from a history of violence and to promote sustainable peace across the generations, Community Based Sociotherapy Rwanda (CBS Rwanda) in partnership
                                            with the Dutch NGO Radio La Benevolencija (RLB), initiated a new project called the Tujyane.</p>

                                        <p>Tujyane (“Let’s Go Together”) Project is a two-year project which is funded by the European Union and aims to contribute to democratization processes and equitable development by supporting the reintegration process
                                            of ex-prisoners and mitigating the negative impacts of intergenerational legacies of the genocide, including the transmission of trauma, violence and divisionism. The project will be implemented in Nyabihu,
                                            Nyamasheke and Rusizi districts.</p>

                                        <p>In the Tujyane Project, community-based sociotherapy is used to enhance feelings of safety, trust and social dignity, and support processes of reconciliation, social cohesion and family and community conflict resolution.
                                            In addition to that, grassroots advocacy initiatives will be stimulated and facilitated through the People’s Parliament for Peace (PP4P) meetings. These approaches will be complemented by the national radio
                                            drama Musekeweya, developed and produced by RLB. Musekeweya seeks to make national populations recognize and resist stereotyping, hate speech, identity manipulation and incitement to violence. The drama will
                                            feature a special focus on the psychology of reintegration of ex-prisoners as well as the consequences of the intergenerational legacies of the genocide. The storyline and scripts will be adapted to the evolving
                                            context and input and feedback from the sociotherapy groups and radio listening clubs.</p>

                                        <h3><strong>Expected outcomes</strong></h3>
                                        <p>The project is expected to bring an important change in Rwandan society in terms of psychosocial lives, social cohesion, unity and reconciliation, and sustainable peace. Expected results of this project include
                                            the following:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Increased sense of psychosocial well-being, self-efficacy and acceptance among ex-prisoners and other members of the selected communities.</li>
                                            <li>Increased citizen participation in community reintegration processes as well as engagement in grassroots advocacy.</li>
                                            <li>Increased knowledge and understanding of the effect of historical legacies on social cohesion and ability to recognize and resist divisive ideologies, incitement to violence and identity-based manipulation.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Together with national and local stakeholders, CBS Rwanda and RLB will combine approaches and efforts as organizations complementing one another.</p>

                                        The <b>community-based sociotherapy approach </b>has been developed in Rwanda in 2005 by the Dutch sociotherapist, Cora Dekker, in partnership with E.A.R. Byumba Diocese. The approach uses the group as a therapeutic
                                        medium to create trust, an open environment for discussion and the formation of peer-support structures. The uniqueness of sociotherapy is that it is done at community level with people from the same neighborhood
                                        usually representing different socio-historical backgrounds (e.g. genocide survivors or genocide perpetrators), linking the process of psychosocial recovery to the process of grassroots reconciliation and therefore
                                        working on the nexus between mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and peace building.

                                        theatre – RLB encourages people to emulate radio drama’s role models in practice. During this two-year project, ex-prisoner reintegration and issues around intergenerational trauma will be key themes of the broadcasts.
