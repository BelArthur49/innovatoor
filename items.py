25 Social Media Tools

Sprout Social
Sprout Social is, without a doubt, the top choice for social media monitoring tools. Over 30,000 brands worldwide, including huge household names like UNICEF, Subaru, and Shopify, use it to manage their social media marketing.

It comes with five features, including Analytics, Listening, Engagement, Publishing & Scheduling, and Employee Advocacy. It also integrates with the top social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and YouTube.

Hootsuite
Hootsuite is an intuitive tracking tool that has helped business owners achieve incredible success on social media. One candy company owner used its Publishing and Analytics features to help her gain over 16,000 TikTok followers after going viral. In two years, her sales increased by 750%.

Zoho Social
Zoho Social provides you with Analytics, Monitoring, and other valuable features to help you track your social media performance, whether you’re an individual or a full-fledged marketing agency. It was chosen as the best social media management tool for individual creators by Forbes in 2023, but it also comes with features that make it useful for whole teams of marketers.

Meltwater
Meltwater’s comprehensive social media marketing suite includes tools for Social Listening & Analytics, Social Media Management, and Influencer Marketing. Domino’s Pizza used this social media monitoring tool to improve their content and drive up engagement by 5000%.

Agorapulse
Agorapulse comes with everything you’ll need for social media tracking, including features like a social media inbox, publishing, monitoring, reporting, and more. More than 11,000 customers, including both individual marketers and agencies, have found a home with Agorapulse. Many of them praise how it helped them streamline their social media processes.

Sendible
Sendible is a social media tracking tool designed for agencies that has been used by top brands like Expedia, Texas A&M University, and more. With features like the ability to monitor your brand’s performance, schedule your posts, and engage with your customers, you can fulfill every monitoring need from their organized dashboard. One agency called Amelia Rose Media used Sendible to help one of their clients increase engagement by 20%.

Brand24
Brand24 is designed specifically for brands who want to engage in social media monitoring. This software gathers data about mentions and the number of people discussing your brand (AKA discussion volume), but they also calculate your Sentiment Analysis.

Sentiment Analysis tells you how customers feel about your brand from an emotional standpoint, which is incredibly helpful for showing you where you need to take action to improve your online reputation.

Features like these helped Uber use Brand24 to maximize social media buzz about their new app.

Mention
Mention provides basic social media monitoring and management features to help you amplify your brand’s presence online. Not only can you monitor your own brand’s performance on social media with Mention, but you can also track your competitors’. This tool is used by more than 750,000 marketers, including some that work with Microsoft.

Cyfe
Cyfe is an all-in-one dashboard that allows you to monitor all your social media channels, all at the same time. It integrates with many of the most popular platforms, but you can also create custom widgets and upload your own data that you collected from other platforms. Using Cyfe, the brand Drive was able to boost their average customer spend by 89%.

Keyhole
Keyhole’s aim is to help you monitor your brand’s social media performance and then use that data to your advantage. Among its many features are Social Listening & Campaigns, Profile Analytics, Publishing & Scheduling, Influencer Tracking, and Quick Trends – all useful tools that can help improve your reputation as well as your posts. You’ll recognize many of the big brands that have used Keyhole, as they include Google, L’Oréal, and Amazon.

Brandwatch Consumer Intelligence
Delta, Nestle, and GSK are just a few of the companies that use Brandwatch’s Consumer Intelligence platform. This is more than just a social media monitoring tool. This is a dashboard dedicated to gathering millions of datasets related to your brand, driven by powerful artificial intelligence. With Consumer Intelligence, you can easily (and quickly) search, segment, and analyze data before choosing the appropriate action.

Eclincher
Eclincher boasts an impressive array of tools, including a Monitoring & Listening feature, to help businesses improve their social media management game. Whether you’re a small business, an enterprise, or a franchise, Eclincher provides the solutions and integrations you need to expand your social media presence. One of their clients, Jason Gordon, the CEO of Strong Social, declared that Eclincher’s social inbox tools were better than Sprout Social.

Synthesio
Synthesio is an AI-powered consumer intelligence platform that has garnered praise from beauty brand L’Oréal for its time-saving benefits. Synthesio provides fast insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and more, so that you can pivot your social media marketing strategy according to what people are saying about your brand online.

Iconosquare
Monitor your brand’s performance on several social media platforms on a single platform by using Iconosquare. With their Conversations and Listening features, you can track your mentions and keep an eye on your audience to identify ways you can respond to their discussions about your brand or industry. Over 20,000 marketers use Iconosquare, and they’ve also been used by major brands like Netflix, IKEA, Patagonia, and Sony Music.

Tailwind
If your brand has accounts on Facebook, Pinterest, or Instagram only, then Tailwind may be the social media tracking solution for you. This software offers an array of tools to help you plan, create, schedule, and optimize your posts across all three social media platforms. They’re trusted by over 1 million brands, including Shopify, CB2, and Jenny Yoo.

HubSpot
HubSpot’s Marketing Hub gives you access to marketing tools designed to help you increase revenue and grow your business, as well as monitor and improve your social media performance. However, if social media marketing is all you’re looking for, then HubSpot may not be the best choice. This is especially true if you want to track conversations, interactions, and followers across multiple platforms, since this software offers limited coverage of those three types of engagement.

Talkwalker
Talkwalker lets you find and analyze discussions about your brand all across the internet. It even uses image, video, and speech recognition technology to monitor visual as well as text-based conversations. This way, you get a comprehensive view into how your target audience is thinking, feeling, and expressing themselves about your brand, enabling you to jump right in, as well.

Nexalogy
Nexalogy is a social media intelligence and content marketing solution that will give you the data you need to monitor your brand online. It pulls information about your brand from popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, as well as Google Alerts, RSS Feeds, and more. Then it represents them in easy-to-read visualizations that show you the peaks and valleys of your brand’s performance. They’ve been trusted by high-profile clients like Ford, Yellow Pages, and Telefilm Canada.

Mentionlytics
Monitor your brand’s mentions closely with Mentionlytics. This social media tracking tool serves everyone, from small businesses to marketing agencies to public figures. It works by scouring the internet for mentions of your brand name and then giving you tools to join the conversations where those mentions are occurring.

This enables you to take action to further your brand’s reputation quickly. It also comes with Sentiment Analysis and an integration with Hootsuite.

Tweepsmap
Take a deep dive into your brand’s Twitter performance using Tweepsmap. This AI-driven software provides analysis of any Twitter account and a map showing hashtags relevant to the ones you want to monitor. It also allows you to analyze and segment your followers according to your desired specifications. It’s the ultimate Twitter data gathering tool used by Boeing, Visa, Johnson & Johnson, and many other well-known companies.

RivalIQ
RivalIQ wants to help you rise above your competitors. With this software, you can do so much more than monitor your mentions. You can also track your competition, keep up with popular topics in your field, analyze hashtags, and see how your own social media posts are performing. Lung Cancer Alliance and Urban Decay are a couple of examples of companies that have chosen to rely on RivalIQ for their social media tracking needs.

Atribus
Atribus offers a multi-faced social media monitoring tool that is designed to help you improve your brand reputation. You can use this software to track mentions of your brand on the internet. It will also send you alerts whenever a topic you want to monitor is talked about.

You can even use it to generate custom reports to help you evaluate your brand’s reputation on social media according to your desired parameters. Those features, plus the image recognition and competitive intelligence tools, will get you far.

YouScan
YouScan leverages an AI-powered visual scanning technology to search for elements within images that are related to your brand. Using this social media tracking tool will enable you to not only learn what consumers are saying about your brand, products, and services, but also how they’re using them in real time.

This is valuable information that you can use for future marketing, as well as a great opportunity for you to initiate personable interactions with your target audience.

Awario
Awario claims to provide the most immediate results for conversations about your brand across the internet. And they may be right since they crawl apps as well as more than 13 billion webpages every day. With this software, you can monitor mentions of your brand, jump into conversations, and keep track of how your target audience is feeling about your business and your field at large."""
